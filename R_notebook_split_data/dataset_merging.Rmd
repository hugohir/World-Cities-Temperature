This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library("dplyr")
library("plyr")
library("readr")

citytemperature_remergedataset <- list.files("C:/Users/hhira/OneDrive/Documents/DataAnalytics/CityTemperature/Hugo/data_final_to_merge",pattern="*.csv", full.names = TRUE) %>%

  lapply(read_csv) %>%
  bind_rows

citytemperature_remergedataset

#library(plyr)
#citytemperature_final <- ldply(list.files(),read.csv,header=TRUE)
#View(citytemperature_final)

# write_csv(citytemperature_final,"citytemperature_final_test.csv")

```
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
